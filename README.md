## What is Kardmi APK?

## Kardmi Gameplay: Catch, Train, and Battle

### Catching Kardmis
The game begins with the challenge of catching your first Kardmis. As you explore the world, you’ll encounter different types, each with their own elemental attributes like **Water**, **Fire**, **Electric**, and more. Building a balanced team requires understanding the strengths and weaknesses of these types, making **team-building** an essential aspect of the game.

Whether you’re facing wild Kardmis or challenging other trainers, the battle mechanics encourage deep strategic thinking.

### Gym Leaders and Elite Four
As you progress, you’ll face Gym Leaders spread across the world. Each leader specializes in a particular type of Kardmi, and defeating them will earn you valuable **Badges**.
